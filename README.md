## 🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution for the classic **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** Kaggle competition.

The goal is to **predict which passengers survived** the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Ticket class  
- Number of siblings/spouses  
- Number of parents/children  
- Embarkation port, etc.

### **Key Objectives**
- Build and demonstrate a full **end-to-end ML pipeline**
- Apply **professional modular code structure**
- Showcase preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Provide a **production-ready and reusable codebase**
- Achieve competitive prediction accuracy on Kaggle
